#define a class employee with 
#attributes name, weeklyhours, rate, overtimeRate, weeklytaxcredit
# and store these in the constructor
#(20)
#Create a method computeWeeklyPay (self,hours) returning the gross pay of the employee,
# which is the hours up to weeklyhours at rate, plus hours above this at overtimeRate
#(25)
##Create method computeTax(self,grossPay) which returns the tax due at 
#40% on the gross pay, reduced by the tax credit.
#(25)#

#Ensure overtime cannot be negative
#(10)
#weekly pay cannot be negative
#(10)
#Tax cannot be negative
#(10)

#Example:
#if weekly hours is 35, rate is 11, overtimeRate is 15 and hours is 39 computeWeeklyPay
#should return 35*11 + 4*15 = 445

#computeTax(445), if weeklytaxcredit is 70 will return 0.4*445 - 70 = 108
